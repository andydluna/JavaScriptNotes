**JavaScript** is a high-level, prototype-based, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model. ü§Øü§Ø

**High-level**: 

- The developer does not have to worry about managing resources manually; everything happens automatically.

**Prototype-based object-oriented**:

- Each object in JavaScript has a prototype from which it inherits methods that can be used in that object.
    - Example: Arrays inherit methods like `push` or `indexOf`.

**Multi-paradigm**:

- JavaScript supports multiple ways to structure code:
    - **Procedural programming**: Writing code in a sequence of steps.
    - **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: Using objects and classes to structure code.
    - **Functional programming (FP)**: Using functions as the primary building blocks of programs.

**Interpreted or just-in-time compiled**: [[JavaScript Engine and Runtime]]

- JavaScript used to be solely an interpreted language. Nowadays, modern JavaScript engines use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation, which compiles code on the fly, making it faster.

**Dynamic**:

- JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning there are no explicit data type definitions. Data types are determined at runtime, and variables can change types if reassigned.

**Single-threaded**:

- JavaScript runs in a single thread, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. For long-running tasks, JavaScript uses the non-blocking event loop.

**Garbage-collected**:

- JavaScript automatically cleans up memory that is no longer in use, so developers do not have to manage memory manually.

**First-class functions**:

- Functions in JavaScript are treated as variables. They can be passed into other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.

**Non-blocking event loop**:

- JavaScript handles long-running tasks by executing them in the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù and returning the results to the main thread once they are finished. This ensures the main thread is not blocked and can continue executing other code.
